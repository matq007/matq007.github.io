## Models

- **Medicine**
  - MedGemma: Fine-tuned Gemini multimodal model for medicine
    - Paper: <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03162>
    - HF: <https://huggingface.co/collections/google/medgemma-release-680aade845f90bec6a3f60c4>
    - Code: <https://github.com/Google-Health/medgemma/tree/main/notebooks>
    - My notebooks:
    - Notes:
      - Also measures Polygenic Risk Score (part of genomics layer)
      - Weights are not released as they are still not confident in full accuracy of the model and are worried of misuse by non-trained clinicians

## Techniques

- Polygenic Risk Score
- LoRA
- Gated Multi-head Attention
- Simple Gated Linear Unit

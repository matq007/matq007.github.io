## 👾 IT

- Well, Google just dropped Veo 3 at I/o Keynote which generates quite realistic
shorts videos ([link](https://gizmodo.com/googles-veo-3-is-already-deepfaking-all-of-youtubes-most-smooth-brained-content-2000606144)).

## 🔬Science

- Long read on about mitochondria, their fascinating history (originally bacteria
which was consumed by an ancestral cell long time ago); fascinating functioning
thought "social" queues and link to numerous diseases ([link](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-mitochondria-are-more-like-a-motherboard-than-the-powerhouse-of-the-cell/)).
- _Gharibi et al., 2025_ introduces 3D model culturing hESCs towards post-gastrulation
amnion. A big milestone as it allows researchers to study and perturb this developmental
process in vitro. These models could be provided as an alternative amniotic membranes
in future clinical settings ([link](https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2025-05-15_new-stem-cell-model-sheds-light-on-human-amniotic-sac-development)).
- _Abukar et al., 2025_  uses light-sheet microscopy to track hearth development in mouse
providing new insights into the intricacies of cell movement and coordination
([link](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44318-025-00441-0)).
- Great podcast episode from Quanta Magazine discussing latest research on how
LLM are not as great as initially thought when it comes to learning "new"
languages ([link](https://play.prx.org/listen?ge=prx_11709_03933b19-007e-4e69-82da-26d8e303f3c)).

A new research from Stanford showed promising results tackling osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) by inhibition of 15-hydroxy prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH). They categorize this gene as gerozyme, meaning it increases its activity with age. The research shows that inhibition (down-regulation of signal) helps with **rejuvenation** of the cartilage. The hope is that in future, simple drug treatment could help with restoration of cartilage targeting elderly population, post-surgery patients or ACL-like injuries. This could be huge for osteoarthritis since cartilage rejuvenation is primarily done with stem cells. So far phase 1 clinical trials confirmed safety of drug administration in mice.

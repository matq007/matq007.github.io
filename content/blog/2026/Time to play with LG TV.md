If you own a LG TV and are completely fed up with the random endless impossible to skip Youtube Ads, you have two options. Either buy the subscription, or install [Youtube AdFree](https://repo.webosbrew.org/apps/youtube.leanback.v4/) via [WebOSBrew](https://www.webosbrew.org). To do that you have to decide between rooting your TV (voids the warranty) or enable development mode which has it's limitations but can be a good starting point. If interested, follow the [guide here](https://www.webosbrew.org/#get-started). Kudos to the developers and the amazing work which allows developing and installing apps outside of LG's operating system ecosystem.

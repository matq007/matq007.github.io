## 👾 IT

- Commentary from Garry Marcus on the latest criticism of LLMs "reasoning" from Apple ([link](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/a-knockout-blow-for-llms)).
  - Interesting notes:
    - LLM might fail from inference outside of training distribution (out-of-distribution), same problem as perceptron
    - The main take home is that LLMs are not thinking, at least based on puzzle examples in the paper
- OS for public sector by EU, currently POC ([link](https://eu-os.eu/)).

## 🔬Science

- Focused ultrasound stimulation could be the alternative treatment in future ([link](https://spectrum.ieee.org/focused-ultrasound-stimulation-inflammation-diabetes)).
  - Idea started with chronic inflammation; possible other candidates are diabetes (already tested on mice, pigs and was published)
  - Could be converted into wearable device in future, allowing easy access for anyone

## Hi there! 👋

<img class="avatar" src="/me.png" width="150" align="right" />

My name is Martin and I currently work as a **Senior Bioinformatician** at [ZS]
in Copenhagen, 🇩🇰. Previously, I did my research at reNEW, University of Copenhagen
in [Brickman] and [Sedzinski] lab, where I obtained my **PhD in stem cell research**.
My work focused on developing computational tools utilizing high-dimensional datasets
to unravel cell fate choice by inferring gene regulatory networks.

You can find my research publications and collaboration projects

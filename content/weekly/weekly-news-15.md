### [Entropy subspace separation-based clustering for noise reduction (ENCORE) of scRNA-seq data](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/49/3/e18/6030236)

_Song et al., Nucleic Acids Research (2021)_

_Single-cell RNA sequencing enables us to characterize the cellular heterogeneity in single cell resolution with the help of cell type identification algorithms. However, the noise inherent in single-cell RNA-sequencing data severely disturbs the accuracy of cell clustering, marker identification and visualization. We propose that clustering based on feature density profiles can distinguish informative features from noise. We named such strategy as ‚Äòentropy subspace‚Äô separation and designed a cell clustering algorithm called ENtropy subspace separation-based Clustering for nOise REduction (ENCORE) by integrating the ‚Äòentropy subspace‚Äô separation strategy with a consensus clustering method. We demonstrate that ENCORE performs superiorly on cell clustering and generates high-resolution visualization across 12 standard datasets. More importantly, ENCORE enables identification of group markers with biological significance from a hard-to-separate dataset. With the advantages of effective feature selection, improved clustering, accurate marker identification and high-resolution visualization, we present ENCORE to the community as an important tool for scRNA-seq data analysis to study cellular heterogeneity and discover group markers._

### [SNT: a unifying toolbox for quantification of neuronal anatomy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01105-7)

_Arshadi et al., Nat Methods (2021)_

<a href="#" class="badge badge-primary">#framework</a>
<a href="#" class="badge badge-primary">#neurons</a>

_SNT is an end-to-end framework for neuronal morphometry and whole-brain connectomics that supports tracing, proof-editing, visualization, quantification and modeling of neuroanatomy. With an open architecture, a large user base, community-based documentation, support for complex imagery and several model organisms, SNT is a flexible resource for the broad neuroscience community. SNT is both a desktop application and multi-language scripting library, and it is available through the Fiji distribution of ImageJ._

### [A three-dimensional virtual mouse generates synthetic training data for behavioral analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01103-9)

_Bola√±os et al., Nat Methods (2021)_

<a href="#" class="badge badge-primary">#mouse</a>
<a href="#" class="badge badge-primary">#model</a>
<a href="#" class="badge badge-primary">#3d</a>

_We developed a three-dimensional (3D) synthetic animated mouse based on computed tomography scans that is actuated using animation and semirandom, joint-constrained movements to generate synthetic behavioral data with ground-truth label locations. Image-domain translation produced realistic synthetic videos used to train two-dimensional (2D) and 3D pose estimation models with accuracy similar to typical manual training datasets. The outputs from the 3D model-based pose estimation yielded better definition of behavioral clusters than 2D videos and may facilitate automated ethological classification._

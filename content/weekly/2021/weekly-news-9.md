### [Accurate feature selection improves single-cell RNA-seq cell clustering]()

_Cell clustering is one of the most important and commonly performed tasks in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. An important step in cell clustering is to select a subset of genes (referred to as ‚Äòfeatures‚Äô), whose expression patterns will then be used for downstream clustering. A good set of features should include the ones that distinguish different cell types, and the quality of such set could have a significant impact on the clustering accuracy. All existing scRNA-seq clustering tools include a feature selection step relying on some simple unsupervised feature selection methods, mostly based on the statistical moments of gene-wise expression distributions. In this work, we carefully evaluate the impact of feature selection on cell clustering accuracy. In addition, we develop a feature selection algorithm named FEAture SelecTion (FEAST), which provides more representative features. We apply the method on 12 public scRNA-seq datasets and demonstrate that using features selected by FEAST with existing clustering tools significantly improve the clustering accuracy._

### [Reproducibility in systems biology modelling](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20209982)

_Tiwari et al., Mol Sys Biol 2021_

<a href="#" class="badge badge-primary">#reproducibility</a>

_Reproducibility of scientific results is a key element of science and credibility. The lack of reproducibility across many scientific fields has emerged as an important concern. In this piece, we assess mathematical model reproducibility and propose a score card for improving reproducibility in this field._

### [Speeding up machine hearing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00317-y)

_Carney at al., Nat Mach Intell 2021_

<a href="#" class="badge badge-primary">#ai</a>

_Computational models that capture the nonlinear processing of the inner ear have been prohibitively slow to use for most machine-hearing systems. A convolutional neural network model replicates hallmark features of cochlear signal processing, potentially enabling real-time applications._

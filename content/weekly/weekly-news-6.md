_Other researchers say that restrictions at the largest SARS-CoV-2 genome platform encourage fast sharing while protecting data providers’ rights._

### [GeneWalk identifies relevant gene functions for a biological context using network representation learning](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-021-02264-8)

<a href="#" class="badge badge-primary">#grn</a>

_A bottleneck in high-throughput functional genomics experiments is identifying the most important genes and their relevant functions from a list of gene hits. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment methods provide insight at the gene set level. Here, we introduce GeneWalk ([github.com/churchmanlab/genewalk](github.com/churchmanlab/genewalk)) that identifies individual genes and their relevant functions critical for the experimental setting under examination. After the automatic assembly of an experiment-specific gene regulatory network, GeneWalk uses representation learning to quantify the similarity between vector representations of each gene and its GO annotations, yielding annotation significance scores that reflect the experimental context. By performing gene- and condition-specific functional analysis, GeneWalk converts a list of genes into data-driven hypotheses._

### [Adversarial generation of gene expression data](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab035/6104825)

_High-throughput gene expression can be used to address a wide range of fundamental biological problems, but datasets of an appropriate size are often unavailable. Moreover, existing transcriptomics simulators have been criticized because they fail to emulate key properties of gene expression data. In this article, we develop a method based on a conditional generative adversarial network to generate realistic transcriptomics data for Escherichia coli and humans. We assess the performance of our approach across several tissues and cancer-types._

## <i class="far fa-surprise"></i> Did you know?

Scientists from University of Maryland have created a transparent wood. At first,
hydrogen peroxide was applied on a sheet of one millimetre thick wood which was
exposed to sun for one hour. The wood became white and further fused with transparent
epoxy to harden it. The final product is transparent woord which is harder compared
to glass. In future, this material could possibly replace glass in windows. Read
the original publication [here](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/5/eabd7342).

Although a few databases exist for users to query genes of interest within the scRNA-seq studies, search tools that enable users to find orthologous genes and their cell type-specific expression patterns across species are limited. Here, we built a new search database, DRscDB (https://www.flyrnai.org/tools/single_cell/web/), to address this need. DRscDB serves as a comprehensive repository for published scRNA-seq datasets for Drosophila and relevant datasets from human and other model organisms. DRscDB is based on manual curation of Drosophila scRNA-seq studies of various tissue types and their corresponding analogous tissues in vertebrates including zebrafish, mouse, and human. Of note, our search database provides most of the literature-derived marker genes, thus preserving the original analysis of the published scRNA-seq datasets. Finally, DRscDB serves as a web-based user interface that allows users to mine gene expression data from scRNA-seq studies and perform cell cluster enrichment analyses pertaining to various scRNA-seq studies, both within and across species.\nA single-embryo, single-cell time-resolved model for mouse gastrulation # Mittnenzweig et al., Cell Press (2021)\n#mouse #scrna-seq #gastrulation\nMouse embryonic development is a canonical model system for studying mammalian cell fate acquisition. Recently, single-cell atlases comprehensively charted embryonic transcriptional landscapes, yet inference of the coordinated dynamics of cells over such atlases remains challenging. Here, we introduce a temporal model for mouse gastrulation, consisting of data from 153 individually sampled embryos spanning 36 h of molecular diversification. Using algorithms and precise timing, we infer differentiation flows and lineage specification dynamics over the embryonic transcriptional manifold. Rapid transcriptional bifurcations characterize the commitment of early specialized node and blood cells. However, for most lineages, we observe combinatorial multi-furcation dynamics rather than hierarchical transcriptional transitions. In the mesoderm, dozens of transcription factors combinatorially regulate multifurcations, as we exemplify using time-matched chimeric embryos of Foxc1/Foxc2 mutants. Our study rejects the notion of differentiation being governed by a series of binary choices, providing an alternative quantitative model for cell fate acquisition.\nBayesian inference of gene expression states from single-cell RNA-seq data # Breda et al., Nat Biotechnol (2021)\n#scrna-seq #gene-expression\nDespite substantial progress in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis methods, there is still little agreement on how to best normalize such data. Starting from the basic requirements that inferred expression states should correct for both biological and measurement sampling noise and that changes in expression should be measured in terms of fold changes, we here derive a Bayesian normalization procedure called Sanity (SAmpling-Noise-corrected Inference of Transcription activitY) from first principles. Sanity estimates expression values and associated error bars directly from raw unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts without any tunable parameters. Using simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets, we show that Sanity outperforms other normalization methods on downstream tasks, such as finding nearest-neighbor cells and clustering cells into subtypes. Moreover, we show that by systematically overestimating the expression variability of genes with low expression and by introducing spurious correlations through mapping the data to a lower-dimensional representation, other methods yield severely distorted pictures of the data.\nGene signature extraction and cell identity recognition at the single-cell level with Cell-ID # Cortal et al., Nat Biotechnol (2021)\n#scrna-seq #clustering\nBecause of the stochasticity associated with high-throughput single-cell sequencing, current methods for exploring cell-type diversity rely on clustering-based computational approaches in which heterogeneity is characterized at cell subpopulation rather than at full single-cell resolution. Here we present Cell-ID, a clustering-free multivariate statistical method for the robust extraction of per-cell gene signatures from single-cell sequencing data. We applied Cell-ID to data from multiple human and mouse samples, including blood cells, pancreatic islets and airway, intestinal and olfactory epithelium, as well as to comprehensive mouse cell atlas datasets. We demonstrate that Cell-ID signatures are reproducible across different donors, tissues of origin, species and single-cell omics technologies, and can be used for automatic cell-type annotation and cell matching across datasets. Cell-ID improves biological interpretation at individual cell level, enabling discovery of previously uncharacterized rare cell types or cell states. Cell-ID is distributed as an open-source R software package.\nPCprophet: a framework for protein complex prediction and differential analysis using proteomic data # Fossati et al., Nat Methods (2021)\n#scrna-seq\nDespite the availability of methods for analyzing protein complexes, systematic analysis of complexes under multiple conditions remains challenging. Approaches based on biochemical fractionation of intact, native complexes and correlation of protein profiles have shown promise. However, most approaches for interpreting cofractionation datasets to yield complex composition and rearrangements between samples depend considerably on protein‚Äìprotein interaction inference. We introduce PCprophet, a toolkit built on size exclusion chromatography‚Äìsequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectrometry (SEC-SWATH-MS) data to predict protein complexes and characterize their changes across experimental conditions. We demonstrate improved performance of PCprophet over state-of-the-art approaches and introduce a Bayesian approach to analyze altered protein‚Äìprotein interactions across conditions. We provide both command-line and graphical interfaces to support the application of PCprophet to any cofractionation MS dataset, independent of separation or quantitative liquid chromatography‚ÄìMS workflow, for the detection and quantitative tracking of protein complexes and their physiological dynamics.\nTools # Jupyter-flex: Dashboards for Jupyter # Build dashboard using Jupyter Notebooks.\nFirst Steps #5: Pluto.jl # Pluto.jl is a newcomer (PlutoCon 2021 was just held to celebrate its one-year anniversary!) to the world of notebook environments.

Traditional approaches either solve a coarse model with selective refinement or coerce a detailed model into faster sampling, both of which have limitations. Here, we present a paradigm of adaptive, multiscale simulations that couple different scales using a dynamic-importance sampling approach. Our method uses machine learning to dynamically and exhaustively sample the phase space explored by a macro model using microscale simulations and enables an automatic feedback from the micro to the macro scale, leading to a self-healing multiscale simulation. As a result, our approach delivers macro length and time scales, but with the effective precision of the micro scale. Our approach is arbitrarily scalable as well as transferable to many different types of simulations. Our method made possible a multiscale scientific campaign of unprecedented scale to understand the interactions of RAS proteins with a plasma membrane in the context of cancer research running over several days on Sierra, which is currently the second-most-powerful supercomputer in the world.\nIterative single-cell multi-omic integration using online learning # Gao et al., Nat Biotechnol (2021)\n#scrna-seq #integration #multimodal\nIntegrating large single-cell gene expression, chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation datasets requires general and scalable computational approaches. Here we describe online integrative non-negative matrix factorization (iNMF), an algorithm for integrating large, diverse and continually arriving single-cell datasets. Our approach scales to arbitrarily large numbers of cells using fixed memory, iteratively incorporates new datasets as they are generated and allows many users to simultaneously analyze a single copy of a large dataset by streaming it over the internet. Iterative data addition can also be used to map new data to a reference dataset. Comparisons with previous methods indicate that the improvements in efficiency do not sacrifice dataset alignment and cluster preservation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of online iNMF by integrating more than 1 million cells on a standard laptop, integrating large single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic datasets, and iteratively constructing a single-cell multi-omic atlas of the mouse motor cortex.\nIntegration of multiomics data with graph convolutional networks to identify new cancer genes and their associated molecular mechanisms # Schulte-Sasse et al., Nat Mach Intell (2021)\n#ai #multimodal #cancer\nThe increase in available high-throughput molecular data creates computational challenges for the identification of cancer genes. Genetic as well as non-genetic causes contribute to tumorigenesis, and this necessitates the development of predictive models to effectively integrate different data modalities while being interpretable. We introduce EMOGI, an explainable machine learning method based on graph convolutional networks to predict cancer genes by combining multiomics pan-cancer data‚Äîsuch as mutations, copy number changes, DNA methylation and gene expression‚Äîtogether with protein‚Äìprotein interaction (PPI) networks. EMOGI was on average more accurate than other methods across different PPI networks and datasets. We used layer-wise relevance propagation to stratify genes according to whether their classification was driven by the interactome or any of the omics levels, and to identify important modules in the PPI network. We propose 165 novel cancer genes that do not necessarily harbour recurrent alterations but interact with known cancer genes, and we show that they correspond to essential genes from loss-of-function screens. We believe that our method can open new avenues in precision oncology and be applied to predict biomarkers for other complex diseases.\nCompressed sensing for highly efficient imaging transcriptomics # Cleary et al., Nat Biotechnol (2021)\n#imaging\nRecent methods for spatial imaging of tissue samples can identify up to ~100 individual proteins1,2,3 or RNAs4,5,6,7,8,9,10 at single-cell resolution. However, the number of proteins or genes that can be studied in these approaches is limited by long imaging times. Here we introduce Composite In Situ Imaging (CISI), a method that leverages structure in gene expression across both cells and tissues to limit the number of imaging cycles needed to obtain spatially resolved gene expression maps. CISI defines gene modules that can be detected using composite measurements from imaging probes for subsets of genes. The data are then decompressed to recover expression values for individual genes. CISI further reduces imaging time by not relying on spot-level resolution, enabling lower magnification acquisition, and is overall about 500-fold more efficient than current methods. Applying CISI to 12 mouse brain sections, we accurately recovered the spatial abundance of 37 individual genes from 11 composite measurements covering 180‚Äâmm2 and 476,276 cells.\nModeling transcriptional regulation using gene regulatory networks based on multi-omics data sources # Patel et al., BMC Bioinformatics (2021)\n#grn\nTranscriptional regulation is complex, requiring multiple cis (local) and trans acting mechanisms working in concert to drive gene expression, with disruption of these processes linked to multiple diseases. Previous computational attempts to understand the influence of regulatory mechanisms on gene expression have used prediction models containing input features derived from cis regulatory factors. However, local chromatin looping and trans-acting mechanisms are known to also influence transcriptional regulation, and their inclusion may improve model accuracy and interpretation. In this study, we create a general model of transcription factor influence on gene expression by incorporating both cis and trans gene regulatory features. We describe a computational framework to model gene expression for GM12878 and K562 cell lines. This framework weights the impact of transcription factor-based regulatory data using multi-omics gene regulatory networks to account for both cis and trans acting mechanisms, and measures of the local chromatin context. These prediction models perform significantly better compared to models containing cis-regulatory features alone. Models that additionally integrate long distance chromatin interactions (or chromatin looping) between distal transcription factor binding regions and gene promoters also show improved accuracy. As a demonstration of their utility, effect estimates from these models were used to weight cis-regulatory rare variants for sequence kernel association test analyses of gene expression. Our models generate refined effect estimates for the influence of individual transcription factors on gene expression, allowing characterization of their roles across the genome. This work also provides a framework for integrating multiple data types into a single model of transcriptional regulation.\nProgramming # Clever Hack Finds Mystery CPU Instructions # Enterprising Programmer Uses x86 Microcode to Reveal Itself\nA Better Model for Stacked (GitHub) Pull Requests # How to make a stacked PR.\nBasic Music Theory in ~200 Lines of Python # This article explains the very basics of Western music theory in around 200 lines of Python.\nEvolving Reinforcement Learning Algorithms # The authors show that it‚Äôs possible to learn new, analytically interpretable and generalizable RL algorithms by using a graph representation and applying optimization techniques from the AutoML community.\nTools # Pytlicek/sheet2dict # Simple XLSX and CSV to dictionary converter.\nZellij: a Rusty terminal workspace releases a beta # A terminal workspace with batteries included.\nLitmaps # Litmaps combines interactive citation maps, modern search tools, and regular email updates, to create the best research discovery experience ever.\nStarboard # The shareable in-browser notebook.\ngruntwork-io/git-xargs # git-xargs is a command-line tool (CLI) for making updates across multiple Github repositories with a single command.\nMarkShow # Markdown to Slideshow (Powered by Reveal.js).\nGuides and Tutorials # An Alternative to the Correlation Coefficient That Works For Numeric and Categorical Variables # by Dr. Rama Ramakrishnan.\nMarch 2021: \u0026ldquo;Top 40\u0026rdquo; New CRAN Packages # by Joseph Rickert.\nOthers # Pokemon or Big Data # Guess from the name if it\u0026rsquo;s a Pokemon or Big Data platform/tool.\nLong read # Feynman: I am burned out and I\u0026rsquo;ll never accomplish anything (1985) How often do people actually copy and paste from Stack Overflow?

Here, we combine the CUT\u0026amp;Tag technology, developed to measure bulk histone modifications, with droplet-based single-cell library preparation to produce high-quality single-cell data on chromatin modifications. We apply single-cell CUT\u0026amp;Tag (scCUT\u0026amp;Tag) to tens of thousands of cells of the mouse central nervous system and probe histone modifications characteristic of active promoters, enhancers and gene bodies (H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H3K36me3) and inactive regions (H3K27me3). These scCUT\u0026amp;Tag profiles were sufficient to determine cell identity and deconvolute regulatory principles such as promoter bivalency, spreading of H3K4me3 and promoter‚Äìenhancer connectivity. We also used scCUT\u0026amp;Tag to investigate the single-cell chromatin occupancy of transcription factor OLIG2 and the cohesin complex component RAD21.

Tuning of network architectures is essential for a CNN‚Äôs performance, yet it requires substantial knowledge of machine learning and commitment of time and effort. This process thus imposes a major barrier to broad and effective application of modern deep learning in genomics. Here we present Automated Modelling for Biological Evidence-based Research (AMBER), a fully automated framework to efficiently design and apply CNNs for genomic sequences. AMBER designs optimal models for user-specified biological questions through the state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS). We applied AMBER to the task of modelling genomic regulatory features and demonstrated that the predictions of the AMBER-designed model are significantly more accurate than the equivalent baseline non-NAS models and match or even exceed published expert-designed models. Interpretation of AMBER architecture search revealed its design principles of utilizing the full space of computational operations for accurately modelling genomic sequences. Furthermore, we illustrated the use of AMBER to accurately discover functional genomic variants in allele-specific binding and disease heritability enrichment. AMBER provides an efficient automated method for designing accurate deep learning models in genomics.\nCommon pitfalls and recommendations for using machine learning to detect and prognosticate for COVID-19 using chest radiographs and CT scans # Roberts et al., Nat Mach Intell (2021)\n#covid-19 #machine-learning\nMachine learning methods offer great promise for fast and accurate detection and prognostication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from standard-of-care chest radiographs (CXR) and chest computed tomography (CT) images. Many articles have been published in 2020 describing new machine learning-based models for both of these tasks, but it is unclear which are of potential clinical utility. In this systematic review, we consider all published papers and preprints, for the period from 1 January 2020 to 3 October 2020, which describe new machine learning models for the diagnosis or prognosis of COVID-19 from CXR or CT images. All manuscripts uploaded to bioRxiv, medRxiv and arXiv along with all entries in EMBASE and MEDLINE in this timeframe are considered. Our search identified 2,212 studies, of which 415 were included after initial screening and, after quality screening, 62 studies were included in this systematic review. Our review finds that none of the models identified are of potential clinical use due to methodological flaws and/or underlying biases. This is a major weakness, given the urgency with which validated COVID-19 models are needed. To address this, we give many recommendations which, if followed, will solve these issues and lead to higher-quality model development and well-documented manuscripts.\nSimultaneous trimodal single-cell measurement of transcripts, epitopes, and chromatin accessibility using TEA-seq # Swanson et al., eLife (2021)\n#sequencing\nSingle-cell measurements of cellular characteristics have been instrumental in understanding the heterogeneous pathways that drive differentiation, cellular responses to signals, and human disease. Recent advances have allowed paired capture of protein abundance and transcriptomic state, but a lack of epigenetic information in these assays has left a missing link to gene regulation. Using the heterogeneous mixture of cells in human peripheral blood as a test case, we developed a novel scATAC-seq workflow that increases signal-to-noise and allows paired measurement of cell surface markers and chromatin accessibility: integrated cellular indexing of chromatin landscape and epitopes, called ICICLE-seq. We extended this approach using a droplet-based multiomics platform to develop a trimodal assay that simultaneously measures transcriptomics (scRNA-seq), epitopes, and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) from thousands of single cells, which we term TEA-seq. Together, these multimodal single-cell assays provide a novel toolkit to identify type-specific gene regulation and expression grounded in phenotypically defined cell types.\nTools # smallhadroncollider/taskell # Command-line Kanban board/task manager with support for Trello boards and GitHub projects.\n‚ú® Open source, experimental, and tiny tools roundup # This is a list of small, free, or experimental tools that might be useful in building your game/website/interactive project.

However, the noise inherent in single-cell RNA-sequencing data severely disturbs the accuracy of cell clustering, marker identification and visualization. We propose that clustering based on feature density profiles can distinguish informative features from noise. We named such strategy as ‚Äòentropy subspace‚Äô separation and designed a cell clustering algorithm called ENtropy subspace separation-based Clustering for nOise REduction (ENCORE) by integrating the ‚Äòentropy subspace‚Äô separation strategy with a consensus clustering method. We demonstrate that ENCORE performs superiorly on cell clustering and generates high-resolution visualization across 12 standard datasets. More importantly, ENCORE enables identification of group markers with biological significance from a hard-to-separate dataset. With the advantages of effective feature selection, improved clustering, accurate marker identification and high-resolution visualization, we present ENCORE to the community as an important tool for scRNA-seq data analysis to study cellular heterogeneity and discover group markers.\nSNT: a unifying toolbox for quantification of neuronal anatomy # Arshadi et al., Nat Methods (2021)\n#framework #neurons\nSNT is an end-to-end framework for neuronal morphometry and whole-brain connectomics that supports tracing, proof-editing, visualization, quantification and modeling of neuroanatomy.

Current methods typically achieve integration using shared cell types or covariance correlation between datasets, which can distort biological signals. Here we introduce an algorithm that uses the gene eigenvectors from a reference dataset to establish a global frame for integration. Using simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate that this approach, called Reference Principal Component Integration (RPCI), consistently outperforms other methods by multiple metrics, with clear advantages in preserving genuine cross-sample gene expression differences in matching cell types, such as those present in cells at distinct developmental stages or in perturbated versus control studies. Moreover, RPCI maintains this robust performance when multiple datasets are integrated. Finally, we applied RPCI to scRNA-seq data for mouse gut endoderm development and revealed temporal emergence of genetic programs helping establish the anterior‚Äìposterior axis in visceral endoderm.\nIntegrated intra‚Äê and intercellular signaling knowledge for multicellular omics analysis # Turei et al., Mol Sys Biol (2021)\n#signaling #cell-interactions\nMolecular knowledge of biological processes is a cornerstone in omics data analysis. Applied to single‚Äêcell data, such analyses provide mechanistic insights into individual cells and their interactions. However, knowledge of intercellular communication is scarce, scattered across resources, and not linked to intracellular processes. To address this gap, we combined over 100 resources covering interactions and roles of proteins in inter‚Äê and intracellular signaling, as well as transcriptional and post‚Äêtranscriptional regulation. We added protein complex information and annotations on function, localization, and role in diseases for each protein. The resource is available for human, and via homology translation for mouse and rat. The data are accessible via OmniPath‚Äôs web service (https://omnipathdb.org/), a Cytoscape plug‚Äêin, and packages in R/Bioconductor and Python, providing access options for computational and experimental scientists. We created workflows with tutorials to facilitate the analysis of cell‚Äìcell interactions and affected downstream intracellular signaling processes. OmniPath provides a single access point to knowledge spanning intra‚Äê and intercellular processes for data analysis, as we demonstrate in applications studying SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 infection and ulcerative colitis.\nsepal: identifying transcript profiles with spatial patterns by diffusion-based modeling # Andersson et al., Bioinformatics (2021)\n#spatial-transcriptomics\nCollection of spatial signals in large numbers has become a routine task in multiple omics-fields, but parsing of these rich datasets still pose certain challenges. In whole or near-full transcriptome spatial techniques, spurious expression profiles are intermixed with those exhibiting an organized structure. To distinguish profiles with spatial patterns from the background noise, a metric that enables quantification of spatial structure is desirable. Current methods designed for similar purposes tend to be built around a framework of statistical hypothesis testing, hence we were compelled to explore a fundamentally different strategy. We propose an unexplored approach to analyze spatial transcriptomics data, simulating diffusion of individual transcripts to extract genes with spatial patterns. The method performed as expected when presented with synthetic data. When applied to real data, it identified genes with distinct spatial profiles, involved in key biological processes or characteristic for certain cell types. Compared to existing methods, ours seemed to be less informed by the genes‚Äô expression levels and showed better time performance when run with multiple cores.\nUser-friendly, scalable tools and workflows for single-cell RNA-seq analysis # Moreno et al., Nat Methods (2021)\n#portal #scrna-seq\nAs single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) becomes widespread, accessible and scalable computational pipelines for data analysis are needed. We introduce an interactive computational environment for single-cell studies based on Galaxy1, with functions from established workflows. Single Cell Interactive Application (SCiAp) provides easy access to data from the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) and EMBL-EBI‚Äôs Single Cell Expression Atlas (SCEA)2 projects and can be deployed on different computing platforms, making single-cell data analysis of large-scale projects accessible to the scientific community.\nEnabling high‚Äêthroughput biology with flexible open‚Äêsource automation # Chory et al., Mol Sys Biol (2021)\n#automation #lab\nOur understanding of complex living systems is limited by our capacity to perform experiments in high throughput. While robotic systems have automated many traditional hand‚Äêpipetting protocols, software limitations have precluded more advanced maneuvers required to manipulate, maintain, and monitor hundreds of experiments in parallel. Here, we present Pyhamilton, an open‚Äêsource Python platform that can execute complex pipetting patterns required for custom high‚Äêthroughput experiments such as the simulation of metapopulation dynamics. With an integrated plate reader, we maintain nearly 500 remotely monitored bacterial cultures in log‚Äêphase growth for days without user intervention by taking regular density measurements to adjust the robotic method in real‚Äêtime. Using these capabilities, we systematically optimize bioreactor protein production by monitoring the fluorescent protein expression and growth rates of a hundred different continuous culture conditions in triplicate to comprehensively sample the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus fitness landscape. Our results demonstrate that flexible software can empower existing hardware to enable new types and scales of experiments, empowering areas from biomanufacturing to fundamental biology.\nCytoTree: an R/Bioconductor package for analysis and visualization of flow and mass cytometry data # Dai et al., BMC Bioinformatics (2021)\n#cytometry\nThe rapidly increasing dimensionality and throughput of flow and mass cytometry data necessitate new bioinformatics tools for analysis and interpretation, and the recently emerging single-cell-based algorithms provide a powerful strategy to meet this challenge. Here, we present CytoTree, an R/Bioconductor package designed to analyze and interpret multidimensional flow and mass cytometry data. CytoTree provides multiple computational functionalities that integrate most of the commonly used techniques in unsupervised clustering and dimensionality reduction and, more importantly, support the construction of a tree-shaped trajectory based on the minimum spanning tree algorithm. A graph-based algorithm is also implemented to estimate the pseudotime and infer intermediate-state cells. We apply CytoTree to several examples of mass cytometry and time-course flow cytometry data on heterogeneity-based cytology and differentiation/reprogramming experiments to illustrate the practical utility achieved in a fast and convenient manner. CytoTree represents a versatile tool for analyzing multidimensional flow and mass cytometry data and to producing heuristic results for trajectory construction and pseudotime estimation in an integrated workflow.\nProgramming # How we built our Python Client that\u0026rsquo;s mostly Rust # In this post, we‚Äôll talk about how we were able to leverage some of the great Rust tools to build a Python client without writing much Python itself.\nHow to implement a hash table (in C) # Summary: An explanation of how to implement a simple hash table data structure using the C programming language.

However, these simple culture systems lack the complexity to adequately model the spatiotemporal cellular and molecular dynamics that occur during early embryonic development. Here we describe the reprogramming of fibroblasts into in vitro three-dimensional models of the human blastocyst, termed iBlastoids. Characterization of iBlastoids shows that they model the overall architecture of blastocysts, presenting an inner cell mass-like structure, with epiblast- and primitive endoderm-like cells, a blastocoel-like cavity and a trophectoderm-like outer layer of cells. Single-cell transcriptomics further confirmed the presence of epiblast-, primitive endoderm-, and trophectoderm-like cells. Moreover, iBlastoids can give rise to pluripotent and trophoblast stem cells and are capable of modelling, in vitro, several aspects of the early stage of implantation. In summary, we have developed a scalable and tractable system to model human blastocyst biology; we envision that this will facilitate the study of early human development and the effects of gene mutations and toxins during early embryogenesis, as well as aiding in the development of new therapies associated with in vitro fertilization.\nBlastocyst-like structures generated from human pluripotent stem cells # Yu et al., Nature (2021)\n#blastocyst #human #scrna-seq\nLimited access to embryos has hampered the study of human embryogenesis and disorders that occur during early pregnancy. Human pluripotent stem cells provide an alternative means to study human development in a dish1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Recent advances in partial embryo models derived from human pluripotent stem cells have enabled human development to be examined at early post-implantation stages8,9,10,11,12,13,14. However, models of the pre-implantation human blastocyst are lacking. Starting from naive human pluripotent stem cells, here we developed an effective three-dimensional culture strategy with successive lineage differentiation and self-organization to generate blastocyst-like structures in vitro. These structures‚Äîwhich we term ‚Äòhuman blastoids‚Äô‚Äîresemble human blastocysts in terms of their morphology, size, cell number, and composition and allocation of different cell lineages. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses also reveal the transcriptomic similarity of blastoids to blastocysts. Human blastoids are amenable to embryonic and extra-embryonic stem cell derivation and can further develop into peri-implantation embryo-like structures in vitro. Using chemical perturbations, we show that specific isozymes of protein kinase C have a critical function in the formation of the blastoid cavity. Human blastoids provide a readily accessible, scalable, versatile and perturbable alternative to blastocysts for studying early human development, understanding early pregnancy loss and gaining insights into early developmental defects.\nChecklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM): A Guide for Authors and Reviewers # Mongan el at., Rad. Artif. Intel (2021)\n#checklist #ai #images\nAn automated framework for efficiently designing deep convolutional neural networks in genomics # Zhang et al., Nat Mach Intell (2021)\n#genomics #ai #amber\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become a standard for analysis of biological sequences. Tuning of network architectures is essential for a CNN‚Äôs performance, yet it requires substantial knowledge of machine learning and commitment of time and effort. This process thus imposes a major barrier to broad and effective application of modern deep learning in genomics. Here we present Automated Modelling for Biological Evidence-based Research (AMBER), a fully automated framework to efficiently design and apply CNNs for genomic sequences. AMBER designs optimal models for user-specified biological questions through the state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS). We applied AMBER to the task of modelling genomic regulatory features and demonstrated that the predictions of the AMBER-designed model are significantly more accurate than the equivalent baseline non-NAS models and match or even exceed published expert-designed models. Interpretation of AMBER architecture search revealed its design principles of utilizing the full space of computational operations for accurately modelling genomic sequences. Furthermore, we illustrated the use of AMBER to accurately discover functional genomic variants in allele-specific binding and disease heritability enrichment. AMBER provides an efficient automated method for designing accurate deep learning models in genomics.\nMachine learning for deciphering cell heterogeneity and gene regulation # Scherer et al., Nat Comput Sci (2021)\n#ai #epigenetics\nEpigenetics studies inheritable and reversible modifications of DNA that allow cells to control gene expression throughout their development and in response to environmental conditions. In computational epigenomics, machine learning is applied to study various epigenetic mechanisms genome wide. Its aim is to expand our understanding of cell differentiation, that is their specialization, in health and disease. Thus far, most efforts focus on understanding the functional encoding of the genome and on unraveling cell-type heterogeneity. Here, we provide an overview of state-of-the-art computational methods and their underlying statistical concepts, which range from matrix factorization and regularized linear regression to deep learning methods. We further show how the rise of single-cell technology leads to new computational challenges and creates opportunities to further our understanding of epigenetic regulation.\nTools # manutamminen/blaster # BLAST-like algorithm for R\nmathiasbynens/dotfiles # Inspiration for customizing your dot files.

The original ROSETTA functions have been improved and adapted to the R programming environment. The package allows for building and analyzing non-linear interpretable machine learning models. R.ROSETTA gathers combinatorial statistics via rule-based modelling for accessible and transparent results, well-suited for adoption within the greater scientific community. The package also provides statistics and visualization tools that facilitate minimization of analysis bias and noise. The R.ROSETTA package is freely available at https://github.com/komorowskilab/R.ROSETTA. To illustrate the usage of the package, we applied it to a transcriptome dataset from an autism case‚Äìcontrol study. Our tool provided hypotheses for potential co-predictive mechanisms among features that discerned phenotype classes.

Here we introduce AtacWorks, a deep learning toolkit to denoise sequencing coverage and identify regulatory peaks at base-pair resolution from low cell count, low-coverage, or low-quality ATAC-seq data. Models trained by AtacWorks can detect peaks from cell types not seen in the training data, and are generalizable across diverse sample preparations and experimental platforms. We demonstrate that AtacWorks enhances the sensitivity of single-cell experiments by producing results on par with those of conventional methods using ~10 times as many cells, and further show that this framework can be adapted to enable cross-modality inference of protein-DNA interactions. Finally, we establish that AtacWorks can enable new biological discoveries by identifying active regulatory regions associated with lineage priming in rare subpopulations of hematopoietic stem cells.\nDeep learning-based enhancement of epigenomics data with AtacWorks # Lal and Chiang et al., Nat Commun (2021)\n#atac-seq #denoise\nATAC-seq is a widely-applied assay used to measure genome-wide chromatin accessibility; however, its ability to detect active regulatory regions can depend on the depth of sequencing coverage and the signal-to-noise ratio.

However, success has been limited in the areas of relational datasets, particularly for data with low volume, imbalanced groups, and mislabeled cases, with outputs that typically lack transparency and interpretability. The difficulties arise from the subtle overlapping and entanglement of functional and statistical relations at the source level. Hence, we have developed Pattern Discovery and Disentanglement System (PDD), which is able to discover explicit patterns from the data with various sizes, imbalanced groups, and screen out anomalies. We present herein four case studies on biomedical datasets to substantiate the efficacy of PDD. It improves prediction accuracy and facilitates transparent interpretation of discovered knowledge in an explicit representation framework PDD Knowledge Base that links the sources, the patterns, and individual patients. Hence, PDD promises broad and ground-breaking applications in genomic and biomedical machine learning.\nChunkflow: hybrid cloud processing of large 3D images by convolutional nets # Wu et al., Nat Methods (2021)\n#image-processing #distributed-computation\nAutomated microscopes with both high resolution and large field of view are generating terascale and even petascale 3D images. A local cluster might not have enough computational resources to process them in reasonable time, but public cloud platforms can provide computational resources on demand. Convolutional networks have become the state-of-the-art approach for 3D biological image analysis1,2, and cloud processing by 3D convolutional nets has been used for processing independent small image stacks3,4,5. However, cloud computing tools to perform distributed processing of terascale or petascale 3D images by convolutional nets are lacking. Here, we report chunkflow, a framework for distributing computational tasks over both cloud and local computational resources, including both GPUs and CPUs with multiple deep-learning framework back ends, to maximize efficiency, increase flexibility and reduce cost.\nProgramming # R Cheat Sheets # Resource of various cheat sheets for working with R\nTools # omnisci/omniscidb # OmniSci is the world\u0026rsquo;s fastest open source SQL engine, equally powerful at the heart of the OmniSci platform as it is accelerating third-party analytic apps.\nrbreaves/kinto # Linux \u0026amp; Windows with Mac-style shortcut keys.\nClone Wars - Open source clones of popular sites # 70+ open-source clones of popular sites like Airbnb, Amazon, Instagram, Netflix, Tiktok, Spotify, Trello, Whatsapp, Youtube, etc. List contains source code, demo links, tech stack, and, GitHub stars count.

Here we present a software suite for single-cell analysis of regulatory chromatin in R (ArchR; https://www.archrproject.com/) that enables fast and comprehensive analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility data. ArchR provides an intuitive, user-focused interface for complex single-cell analyses, including doublet removal, single-cell clustering and cell type identification, unified peak set generation, cellular trajectory identification, DNA element-to-gene linkage, transcription factor footprinting, mRNA expression level prediction from chromatin accessibility and multi-omic integration with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Enabling the analysis of over 1.2 million single cells within 8‚Äâh on a standard Unix laptop, ArchR is a comprehensive software suite for end-to-end analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility that will accelerate the understanding of gene regulation at the resolution of individual cells.\nUsing prototyping to choose a bioinformatics workflow management system # Jackson et al., Plos Comp Biol 2021\n#scrna-seq\nWorkflow management systems represent, manage, and execute multistep computational analyses and offer many benefits to bioinformaticians. They provide a common language for describing analysis workflows, contributing to reproducibility and to building libraries of reusable components. They can support both incremental build and re-entrancy‚Äîthe ability to selectively re-execute parts of a workflow in the presence of additional inputs or changes in configuration and to resume execution from where a workflow previously stopped. Many workflow management systems enhance portability by supporting the use of containers, high-performance computing (HPC) systems, and clouds. Most importantly, workflow management systems allow bioinformaticians to delegate how their workflows are run to the workflow management system and its developers. This frees the bioinformaticians to focus on what these workflows should do, on their data analyses, and on their science. RiboViz is a package to extract biological insight from ribosome profiling data to help advance understanding of protein synthesis. At the heart of RiboViz is an analysis workflow, implemented in a Python script. To conform to best practices for scientific computing which recommend the use of build tools to automate workflows and to reuse code instead of rewriting it, the authors reimplemented this workflow within a workflow management system. To select a workflow management system, a rapid survey of available systems was undertaken, and candidates were shortlisted: Snakemake, cwltool, Toil, and Nextflow. Each candidate was evaluated by quickly prototyping a subset of the RiboViz workflow, and Nextflow was chosen. The selection process took 10 person-days, a small cost for the assurance that Nextflow satisfied the authors‚Äô requirements. The use of prototyping can offer a low-cost way of making a more informed selection of software to use within projects, rather than relying solely upon reviews and recommendations by others.\nNormalization of single-cell RNA-seq counts by log(x + 1)* or log(1 + x)* # Booeshaghi et al., Bioinformatics 2021\n#scrna-seq #normalization\nSingle-cell RNA-seq technologies have been successfully employed over the past decade to generate many high resolution cell atlases. These have proved invaluable in recent efforts aimed at understanding the cell type specificity of host genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 infections. While single-cell atlases are based on well-sampled highly-expressed genes, many of the genes of interest for understanding SARS-CoV-2 can be expressed at very low levels. Common assumptions underlying standard single-cell analyses don‚Äôt hold when examining low-expressed genes, with the result that standard workflows can produce misleading results.\nAccurate and efficient detection of gene fusions from RNA sequencing data # Uhrig et al., Genome Research 2021\n#fusion-gene\nThe identification of gene fusions from RNA sequencing data is a routine task in cancer research and precision oncology. However, despite the availability of many computational tools, fusion detection remains challenging. Existing methods suffer from poor prediction accuracy and are computationally demanding. We developed Arriba, a novel fusion detection algorithm with high sensitivity and short runtime. When applied to a large collection of published pancreatic cancer samples (n = 803), Arriba identified a variety of driver fusions, many of which affected druggable proteins, including ALK, BRAF, FGFR2, NRG1, NTRK1, NTRK3, RET, and ROS1. The fusions were significantly associated with KRAS wild-type tumors and involved proteins stimulating the MAPK signaling pathway, suggesting that they substitute for activating mutations in KRAS. In addition, we confirmed the transforming potential of two novel fusions, RRBP1-RAF1 and RASGRP1-ATP1A1, in cellular assays. These results show Arriba\u0026rsquo;s utility in both basic cancer research and clinical translation.\nFast searches of large collections of single-cell data using scfind # Lee et al., Nat Methods 2021\n#searching\nSingle-cell technologies have made it possible to profile millions of cells, but for these resources to be useful they must be easy to query and access. To facilitate interactive and intuitive access to single-cell data we have developed scfind, a single-cell analysis tool that facilitates fast search of biologically or clinically relevant marker genes in cell atlases. Using transcriptome data from six mouse cell atlases, we show how scfind can be used to evaluate marker genes, perform in silico gating, and identify both cell-type-specific and housekeeping genes. Moreover, we have developed a subquery optimization routine to ensure that long and complex queries return meaningful results. To make scfind more user friendly, we use indices of PubMed abstracts and techniques from natural language processing to allow for arbitrary queries. Finally, we show how scfind can be used for multi-omics analyses by combining single-cell ATAC-seq data with transcriptome data.\nProgramming # jsonschema # If you ever written a validation schema for XML, you can do the same with JSON.\nTools # MyHeritage # Animate the faces in your family photos with amazing technology.

An important step in cell clustering is to select a subset of genes (referred to as ‚Äòfeatures‚Äô), whose expression patterns will then be used for downstream clustering. A good set of features should include the ones that distinguish different cell types, and the quality of such set could have a significant impact on the clustering accuracy. All existing scRNA-seq clustering tools include a feature selection step relying on some simple unsupervised feature selection methods, mostly based on the statistical moments of gene-wise expression distributions. In this work, we carefully evaluate the impact of feature selection on cell clustering accuracy. In addition, we develop a feature selection algorithm named FEAture SelecTion (FEAST), which provides more representative features. We apply the method on 12 public scRNA-seq datasets and demonstrate that using features selected by FEAST with existing clustering tools significantly improve the clustering accuracy.\nReproducibility in systems biology modelling # Tiwari et al., Mol Sys Biol 2021\n#reproducibility\nReproducibility of scientific results is a key element of science and credibility.

Here, we develop robust cell type decomposition (RCTD), a computational method that leverages cell type profiles learned from single-cell RNA-seq to decompose cell type mixtures while correcting for differences across sequencing technologies. We demonstrate the ability of RCTD to detect mixtures and identify cell types on simulated datasets. Furthermore, RCTD accurately reproduces known cell type and subtype localization patterns in Slide-seq and Visium datasets of the mouse brain. Finally, we show how RCTD‚Äôs recovery of cell type localization enables the discovery of genes within a cell type whose expression depends on spatial environment. Spatial mapping of cell types with RCTD enables the spatial components of cellular identity to be defined, uncovering new principles of cellular organization in biological tissue.

Genozip delivers high-performance compression for widely-used genomic data formats in genomics research, namely FASTQ, SAM/BAM/CRAM, VCF, GVF, FASTA, PHYLIP, and 23andMe formats. Our test results show that Genozip is fast and achieves greatly improved compression ratios, even when the files are already compressed. Further, Genozip is architected with a separation of the Genozip Framework from file-format-specific Segmenters and data-type-specific Codecs. With this, we intend for Genozip to be a general-purpose compression platform where researchers can implement compression for additional file formats, as well as new codecs for data types or fields within files, in the future. We anticipate that this will ultimately increase the visibility and adoption of these algorithms by the user community, thereby accelerating further innovation in this space.\nDimensionality reduction using singular vectors # Afshar et al., Sci Rep 2021\n#feature-selection #singular-vectors\nA common problem in machine learning and pattern recognition is the process of identifying the most relevant features, specifically in dealing with high-dimensional datasets in bioinformatics. In this paper, we propose a new feature selection method, called Singular-Vectors Feature Selection (SVFS). Let ùê∑=[ùê¥‚à£ùêõ] be a labeled dataset, where ùêõ is the class label and features (attributes) are columns of matrix A. We show that the signature matrix ùëÜùê¥=ùêº‚àíùê¥‚Ä†ùê¥ can be used to partition the columns of A into clusters so that columns in a cluster correlate only with the columns in the same cluster. In the first step, SVFS uses the signature matrix ùëÜùê∑ of D to find the cluster that contains ùêõ. We reduce the size of A by discarding features in the other clusters as irrelevant features. In the next step, SVFS uses the signature matrix ùëÜùê¥ of reduced A to partition the remaining features into clusters and choose the most important features from each cluster. Even though SVFS works perfectly on synthetic datasets, comprehensive experiments on real world benchmark and genomic datasets shows that SVFS exhibits overall superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art feature selection methods in terms of accuracy, running time, and memory usage. A Python implementation of SVFS along with the datasets used in this paper are available at https://github.com/Majid1292/SVFS.\nProgramming # Building Rich terminal dashboards # If you haven\u0026rsquo;t heard of package Rich for python, I strongly encourage to check it out.

Here we present a new method for reconstructing naturalistic images and videos from very large single-participant functional magnetic resonance data that leverages the recent success of image-to-image transformation networks. This is achieved by exploiting spatial information obtained from retinotopic mappings across the visual system. More specifically, we first determine what position each voxel in a particular region of interest would represent in the visual field based on its corresponding receptive field location. Then, the 2D image representation of the brain activity on the visual field is passed to a fully convolutional image-to-image network trained to recover the original stimuli using VGG feature loss with an adversarial regularizer. In our experiments, we show that our method offers a significant improvement over existing video reconstruction techniques.\nCompression of quantification uncertainty for scRNA-seq counts # Buren et al., Bioinformatics 2021\n#scrna-seq #compression\nQuantification estimates of gene expression from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data have inherent uncertainty due to reads that map to multiple genes. Many existing scRNA-seq quantification pipelines ignore multi-mapping reads and therefore underestimate expected read counts for many genes. alevin accounts for multi-mapping reads and allows for the generation of ‚Äòinferential replicates‚Äô, which reflect quantification uncertainty. Previous methods have shown improved performance when incorporating these replicates into statistical analyses, but storage and use of these replicates increases computation time and memory requirements. We demonstrate that storing only the mean and variance from a set of inferential replicates (‚Äòcompression‚Äô) is sufficient to capture gene-level quantification uncertainty, while reducing disk storage to as low as 9% of original storage, and memory usage when loading data to as low as 6%. Using these values, we generate ‚Äòpseudo-inferential‚Äô replicates from a negative binomial distribution and propose a general procedure for incorporating these replicates into a proposed statistical testing framework. When applying this procedure to trajectory-based differential expression analyses, we show false positives are reduced by more than a third for genes with high levels of quantification uncertainty. We additionally extend the Swish method to incorporate pseudo-inferential replicates and demonstrate improvements in computation time and memory usage without any loss in performance. Lastly, we show that discarding multi-mapping reads can result in significant underestimation of counts for functionally important genes in a real dataset.\nTen simple rules for engaging with artificial intelligence in biomedicine # Malik et at., Plos Comp Bio 2021\n#ai #tips-and-tricks #image-processing\nOrigins of modern human ancestry # Bergstr√∂m et al., Nature 2021\n#history\nNew finds in the palaeoanthropological and genomic records have changed our view of the origins of modern human ancestry. Here we review our current understanding of how the ancestry of modern humans around the globe can be traced into the deep past, and which ancestors it passes through during our journey back in time. We identify three key phases that are surrounded by major questions, and which will be at the frontiers of future research. The most recent phase comprises the worldwide expansion of modern humans between 40 and 60 thousand years ago (ka) and their last known contacts with archaic groups such as Neanderthals and Denisovans. The second phase is associated with a broadly construed African origin of modern human diversity between 60 and 300 ka. The oldest phase comprises the complex separation of modern human ancestors from archaic human groups from 0.3 to 1 million years ago. We argue that no specific point in time can currently be identified at which modern human ancestry was confined to a limited birthplace, and that patterns of the first appearance of anatomical or behavioural traits that are used to define Homo sapiens are consistent with a range of evolutionary histories.\nProgramming # All Pythons are slow, but some are faster than others # Looks like compiling python makes a quite of a difference.\nsatwikkansal/wtfpython # What the f*ck Python?\nTools # conwnet/github1s # Open any GitHub repository in Visual Studio Code right in your browser.\nkloudi # Enter commands and queries to search, view and perform actions on data from all your engineering tools.\njarred-sumner/git-peek # Fastest way to open a remote git repository in your local text editor.\nSourcetrail # Free and open-source cross-platform source explorer\nPrivacy-First AI Security Camera App # Guides and Tutorials # Containerized Python Development ‚Äì Part 1 # Guides from Docker on how to containerized your next Python application.\nShrink your Conda Docker images with conda-pack # Must read if you are using conda in docker container.\nOthers # Dependency Confusion: How I Hacked Into Apple, Microsoft and Dozens of Other Companies # Phishing with Morse code # Information Processing # DECIDE-AI: new reporting guidelines to bridge the development-to-implementation gap in clinical artificial intelligence # Microsoft Excel Becomes a Programming Language # New research tackles a central challenge of powerful quantum computing # You Shall Not Pass # Did you know? # Researchers are working on a novel approach to treat skin cancer - melanoma by altering microbiome using fecal transplant.

Here, we introduce GeneWalk (github.com/churchmanlab/genewalk) that identifies individual genes and their relevant functions critical for the experimental setting under examination. After the automatic assembly of an experiment-specific gene regulatory network, GeneWalk uses representation learning to quantify the similarity between vector representations of each gene and its GO annotations, yielding annotation significance scores that reflect the experimental context. By performing gene- and condition-specific functional analysis, GeneWalk converts a list of genes into data-driven hypotheses.\nAdversarial generation of gene expression data # Vi√±as et al., 2021 Bioinformatics\n#grn #synthetic\nHigh-throughput gene expression can be used to address a wide range of fundamental biological problems, but datasets of an appropriate size are often unavailable.

They offer a unique opportunity to develop powerful machine learning algorithms, including neural networks, to uncover the rules of the cis-regulatory code. However, current modeling assumptions are often not based on state-of-the-art knowledge of the cis-regulatory code from transcription, developmental genetics, imaging, and structural studies. Here I aim to fill this gap by giving a brief historical overview of the field, describing common misconceptions and providing knowledge that might help to guide computational approaches. I will describe the principles and mechanisms involved in the combinatorial requirement of transcription factor binding motifs for enhancer activity, including the role of chromatin accessibility, repressors, and low-affinity motifs in the cis-regulatory code. Deciphering the cis-regulatory code would unlock an enormous amount of regulatory information in the genome and would allow us to locate cis-regulatory genetic variants involved in development and disease.\nProbabilistic harmonization and annotation of single‚Äêcell transcriptomics data with deep generative models # Xu et al., Mol Syst Biol 2021\n#autoencoders #scvi #scanvi\nAs the number of single‚Äêcell transcriptomics datasets grows, the natural next step is to integrate the accumulating data to achieve a common ontology of cell types and states. However, it is not straightforward to compare gene expression levels across datasets and to automatically assign cell type labels in a new dataset based on existing annotations. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that our previously developed method, scVI, provides an effective and fully probabilistic approach for joint representation and analysis of scRNA‚Äêseq data, while accounting for uncertainty caused by biological and measurement noise. We also introduce single‚Äêcell ANnotation using Variational Inference (scANVI), a semi‚Äêsupervised variant of scVI designed to leverage existing cell state annotations. We demonstrate that scVI and scANVI compare favorably to state‚Äêof‚Äêthe‚Äêart methods for data integration and cell state annotation in terms of accuracy, scalability, and adaptability to challenging settings. In contrast to existing methods, scVI and scANVI integrate multiple datasets with a single generative model that can be directly used for downstream tasks, such as differential expression. Both methods are easily accessible through scvi‚Äêtools.\ntidybulk: an R tidy framework for modular transcriptomic data analysis # Mangiola et al., Genome Biol 2021\n#r #bulk #framework\nRecently, efforts have been made toward the harmonization of transcriptomic data structures and workflows using the concept of data tidiness, to facilitate modularisation. We present tidybulk, a modular framework for bulk transcriptional analyses that introduces a tidy transcriptomic data structure paradigm and analysis grammar. Tidybulk covers a wide variety of analysis procedures and integrates a large ecosystem of publicly available analysis algorithms under a common framework. Tidybulk decreases coding burden, facilitates reproducibility, increases efficiency for expert users, lowers the learning curve for inexperienced users, and bridges transcriptional data analysis with the tidyverse.

We find that they output similar results, and to the extent that there are differences, they are irrelevant for downstream analysis. However, the Salmon-Alevin-fry program is significantly slower and requires much more memory to run, making it much more expensive to process large datasets limiting its use to larger servers.\nNanobody-mediated control of gene expression and epigenetic memory # Van et al., Nat Commun 2021\n#nanobody #gene-expression\nTargeting chromatin regulators to specific genomic locations for gene control is emerging as a powerful method in basic research and synthetic biology. However, many chromatin regulators are large, making them difficult to deliver and combine in mammalian cells. Here, we develop a strategy for gene control using small nanobodies that bind and recruit endogenous chromatin regulators to a gene. We show that an antiGFP nanobody can be used to simultaneously visualize GFP-tagged chromatin regulators and control gene expression, and that nanobodies against HP1 and DNMT1 can silence a reporter gene. Moreover, combining nanobodies together or with other regulators, such as DNMT3A or KRAB, can enhance silencing speed and epigenetic memory. Finally, we use the slow silencing speed and high memory of antiDNMT1 to build a signal duration timer and recorder. These results set the basis for using nanobodies against chromatin regulators for controlling gene expression and epigenetic memory.\nProgramming # Discover the best developer blogs on any tech stack # Is meant to be a fun way to discover excellent tech blogs, made by and for developers!

This results in a large number of unnecessary biopsies and subsequent overtreatment. Considering the frequency of the test, there is a critical unmet need of precision screening for prostate cancer. Here, we introduced a urinary multimarker biosensor with a capacity to learn to achieve this goal. The correlation of clinical state with the sensing signals from urinary multimarkers was analyzed by two common machine learning algorithms. As the number of biomarkers was increased, both algorithms provided a monotonic increase in screening performance. Under the best combination of biomarkers, the machine learning algorithms screened prostate cancer patients with more than 99% accuracy using 76 urine specimens. Urinary multimarker biosensor leveraged by machine learning analysis can be an important strategy of precision screening for cancers using a drop of bodily fluid.\nAssessing single-cell transcriptomic variability through density-preserving data visualization # Narayan et al., Nat Biotechnol, 2021\n#visualization #scrna-seq\nNonlinear data visualization methods, such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), summarize the complex transcriptomic landscape of single cells in two dimensions or three dimensions, but they neglect the local density of data points in the original space, often resulting in misleading visualizations where densely populated subsets of cells are given more visual space than warranted by their transcriptional diversity in the dataset. Here we present den-SNE and densMAP, which are density-preserving visualization tools based on t-SNE and UMAP, respectively, and demonstrate their ability to accurately incorporate information about transcriptomic variability into the visual interpretation of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Applied to recently published datasets, our methods reveal significant changes in transcriptomic variability in a range of biological processes, including heterogeneity in transcriptomic variability of immune cells in blood and tumor, human immune cell specialization and the developmental trajectory of Caenorhabditis elegans. Our methods are readily applicable to visualizing high-dimensional data in other scientific domains.\nDeep neural networks identify sequence context features predictive of transcription factor binding # Zheng et al., Nat Mach Intell, 2021\n#ai #prediction #transcription-factor #chip-seq\nTranscription factors bind DNA by recognizing specific sequence motifs, which are typically 6‚Äì12‚Äâbp long. A motif can occur many thousands of times in the human genome, but only a subset of those sites are actually bound. Here we present a machine-learning framework leveraging existing convolutional neural network architectures and model interpretation techniques to identify and interpret sequence context features most important for predicting whether a particular motif instance will be bound. We apply our framework to predict binding at motifs for 38 transcription factors in a lymphoblastoid cell line, score the importance of context sequences at base-pair resolution and characterize context features most predictive of binding. We find that the choice of training data heavily influences classification accuracy and the relative importance of features such as open chromatin. Overall, our framework enables novel insights into features predictive of transcription factor binding and is likely to inform future deep learning applications to interpret non-coding genetic variants.\nAutoMap is a high performance homozygosity mapping tool using next-generation sequencing data # Quinodoz et al., Nat Commun, 2021\n#homozygosity-mapping\nHomozygosity mapping is a powerful method for identifying mutations in patients with recessive conditions, especially in consanguineous families or isolated populations. Historically, it has been used in conjunction with genotypes from highly polymorphic markers, such as DNA microsatellites or common SNPs. Traditional software performs rather poorly with data from Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), which are now extensively used in medical genetics. We develop AutoMap, a tool that is both web-based or downloadable, to allow performing homozygosity mapping directly on VCF (Variant Call Format) calls from WES or WGS projects. Following a training step on WES data from 26 consanguineous families and a validation procedure on a matched cohort, our method shows higher overall performances when compared with eight existing tools. Most importantly, when tested on real cases with negative molecular diagnosis from an internal set, AutoMap detects three gene-disease and multiple variant-disease associations that were previously unrecognized, projecting clear benefits for both molecular diagnosis and research activities in medical genetics.\nA spatially resolved brain region- and cell type-specific isoform atlas of the postnatal mouse brain # #isoform #long-read #spatial-transcriptomics\nSplicing varies across brain regions, but the single-cell resolution of regional variation is unclear. We present a single-cell investigation of differential isoform expression (DIE) between brain regions using single-cell long-read sequencing in mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in 45 cell types at postnatal day 7 (www.isoformAtlas.com). Isoform tests for DIE show better performance than exon tests. We detect hundreds of DIE events traceable to cell types, often corresponding to functionally distinct protein isoforms. Mostly, one cell type is responsible for brain-region specific DIE. However, for fewer genes, multiple cell types influence DIE. Thus, regional identity can, although rarely, override cell-type specificity. Cell types indigenous to one anatomic structure display distinctive DIE, e.g. the choroid plexus epithelium manifests distinct transcription-start-site usage. Spatial transcriptomics and long-read sequencing yield a spatially resolved splicing map. Our methods quantify isoform expression with cell-type and spatial resolution and it contributes to further our understanding of how the brain integrates molecular and cellular complexity.\nProgramming # Improving Indian Language Transliterations in Google Maps # Google Details Patched Bugs in Signal, FB Messenger, JioChat Apps # Why you should never ever use NixOS # Some interesting points about NixOS nad its configuration.\nTools # mackup # Keep your application settings in sync (OS X/Linux)\ncovariants # Real-time updates and information about key SARS-CoV-2 variants, plus the scripts that generate this information.\nGuides and Tutorials # Build 12 Data Science Apps with Python and Streamlit - Full Course # Replace that ShinyApp with Streamlit.\nFrom Novice to Expert: How to Write a Configuration file in Python # Multiple ways how to create configuration file for Python: YAML/JSON, configparser, python-dotenv or dynaconf.\nTesting Python Applications with Pytest [Guide] # Guide how to write tests in python with coverage reports.\nOthers # Imposters hijack journal‚Äôs peer review process to publish substandard papers # Award-winning mentors share their secrets # Did you know? # Since the beginning of the pandemic, Island has sequenced so far 6,000 positive cases of COVID-19 to identify various strains of the virus.

This can be achieved through computational approaches that significantly speed up drug discovery. A powerful approach is to restrict the search to existing drugs through drug repurposing, which can vastly accelerate the usually long approval process. In this Review, we examine a representative set of currently used computational approaches to identify repurposable drugs for COVID-19, as well as their underlying data resources. Furthermore, we compare drug candidates predicted by computational methods to drugs being assessed by clinical trials. Finally, we discuss lessons learned from the reviewed research efforts, including how to successfully connect computational approaches with experimental studies, and propose a unified drug repurposing strategy for better preparedness in the case of future outbreaks.\nisoCirc catalogs full-length circular RNA isoforms in human transcriptomes # Xin et al., Nat Commun, 2021\n#circular-rna #sequencing\nCircular RNAs (circRNAs) have emerged as an important class of functional RNA molecules. Short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a widely used strategy to identify circRNAs. However, an inherent limitation of short-read RNA-seq is that it does not experimentally determine the full-length sequences and exact exonic compositions of circRNAs. Here, we report isoCirc, a strategy for sequencing full-length circRNA isoforms, using rolling circle amplification followed by nanopore long-read sequencing. We describe an integrated computational pipeline to reliably characterize full-length circRNA isoforms using isoCirc data. Using isoCirc, we generate a comprehensive catalog of 107,147 full-length circRNA isoforms across 12 human tissues and one human cell line (HEK293), including 40,628 isoforms ‚â•500 nt in length. We identify widespread alternative splicing events within the internal part of circRNAs, including 720 retained intron events corresponding to a class of exon-intron circRNAs (EIciRNAs). Collectively, isoCirc and the companion dataset provide a useful strategy and resource for studying circRNAs in human transcriptomes.\nA robust unsupervised machine-learning method to quantify the morphological heterogeneity of cells and nuclei # Phillip et al., Nat Protoc, 2021\n#machine-learning #morphology\nCell morphology encodes essential information on many underlying biological processes. It is commonly used by clinicians and researchers in the study, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of human diseases. Quantification of cell morphology has seen tremendous advances in recent years. However, effectively defining morphological shapes and evaluating the extent of morphological heterogeneity within cell populations remain challenging. Here we present a protocol and software for the analysis of cell and nuclear morphology from fluorescence or bright-field images using the VAMPIRE algorithm (https://github.com/kukionfr/VAMPIRE_open). This algorithm enables the profiling and classification of cells into shape modes based on equidistant points along cell and nuclear contours. Examining the distributions of cell morphologies across automatically identified shape modes provides an effective visualization scheme that relates cell shapes to cellular subtypes based on endogenous and exogenous cellular conditions. In addition, these shape mode distributions offer a direct and quantitative way to measure the extent of morphological heterogeneity within cell populations. This protocol is highly automated and fast, with the ability to quantify the morphologies from 2D projections of cells seeded both on 2D substrates or embedded within 3D microenvironments, such as hydrogels and tissues. The complete analysis pipeline can be completed within 60 minutes for a dataset of ~20,000 cells/2,400 images.\nProgramming # Docker BuildKit: faster builds, new features, and now it‚Äôs stable # Speed up your docker image builds by using stable version of BuildKit (Docker \u0026gt;=19.03).\nTo enable it run\nexport DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 add # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.2 at the very beginning of your Dockerfile GitHub security features: highlights from 2020 # With New Year comes new features from GitHub like scanning code for security issues, accidental push of your api keys/tokens or dependency review.

Here we describe the DeepCell Kiosk, cloud-native software that dynamically scales deep learning workflows to accommodate large imaging datasets. To demonstrate the scalability and affordability of this software, we identified cell nuclei in 106 1-megapixel images in ~5.5‚Äâh for ~US$250, with a cost below US$100 achievable depending on cluster configuration. The DeepCell Kiosk can be downloaded at https://github.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk-console; a persistent deployment is available at https://deepcell.org/.\nSpatiotemporal analysis of human intestinal development at single-cell resolution # Fawkner-Corbett et al., Cell, 2021\n#scrna-seq #spatial-transcriptomics #atlas\nüìãMultimodal atlas of intestinal development.\nDevelopment of the human intestine is not well understood. Here, we link single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to characterize intestinal morphogenesis through time. We identify 101 cell states including epithelial and mesenchymal progenitor populations and programs linked to key morphogenetic milestones. We describe principles of crypt-villus axis formation; neural, vascular, mesenchymal morphogenesis, and immune population of the developing gut. We identify the differentiation hierarchies of developing fibroblast and myofibroblast subtypes and describe diverse functions for these including as vascular niche cells. We pinpoint the origins of Peyer‚Äôs patches and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and describe location-specific immune programs. We use our resource to present an unbiased analysis of morphogen gradients that direct sequential waves of cellular differentiation and define cells and locations linked to rare developmental intestinal disorders. We compile a publicly available online resource, spatio-temporal analysis resource of fetal intestinal development (STAR-FINDer), to facilitate further work.\nscMC learns biological variation through the alignment of multiple single-cell genomics datasets # Zhang et al., Genome Biol, 2021\n#scrna-seq #batch-correction #seurat\nüìãNovel scRNA-seq batch correction method which can be easily plugged into your Seurat analysis.\nDistinguishing biological from technical variation is crucial when integrating and comparing single-cell genomics datasets across different experiments. Existing methods lack the capability in explicitly distinguishing these two variations, often leading to the removal of both variations. Here, we present an integration method scMC to remove the technical variation while preserving the intrinsic biological variation. scMC learns biological variation via variance analysis to subtract technical variation inferred in an unsupervised manner. Application of scMC to both simulated and real datasets from single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq experiments demonstrates its capability of detecting context-shared and context-specific biological signals via accurate alignment.\nControl of osteoblast regeneration by a train of Erk activity waves # De Simone et al., Nature, 2021\n#live-imaging #signaling #regeneration #matlab\nüìãInsights into how Erk signaling regulates osteoblasts regeneration in zebrafish.\nRegeneration is a complex chain of events that restores a tissue to its original size and shape. The tissue-wide coordination of cellular dynamics that is needed for proper morphogenesis is challenged by the large dimensions of regenerating body parts. Feedback mechanisms in biochemical pathways can provide effective communication across great distances, but how they might regulate growth during tissue regeneration is unresolved. Here we report that rhythmic travelling waves of Erk activity control the growth of bone in time and space in regenerating zebrafish scales, millimetre-sized discs of protective body armour. We find that waves of Erk activity travel across the osteoblast population as expanding concentric rings that are broadcast from a central source, inducing ring-like patterns of tissue growth. Using a combination of theoretical and experimental analyses, we show that Erk activity propagates as excitable trigger waves that are able to traverse the entire scale in approximately two days and that the frequency of wave generation controls the rate of scale regeneration. Furthermore, the periodic induction of synchronous, tissue-wide activation of Erk in place of travelling waves impairs tissue growth, which indicates that wave-distributed Erk activation is key to regeneration. Our findings reveal trigger waves as a regulatory strategy to coordinate cell behaviour and instruct tissue form during regeneration.\nError correction enables use of Oxford Nanopore technology for reference-free transcriptome analysis # Sahlin et al., Nat Commun, 2021\n#long-read #nano-pore #error-correction\nüìãNano-pore long-read technology suffers from high sequencing error compared to short-read methods. In this paper the authors developed ad new error correction algorithm IsONcorrect to tackle this problem.\nOxford Nanopore (ONT) is a leading long-read technology which has been revolutionizing transcriptome analysis through its capacity to sequence the majority of transcripts from end-to-end. This has greatly increased our ability to study the diversity of transcription mechanisms such as transcription initiation, termination, and alternative splicing. However, ONT still suffers from high error rates which have thus far limited its scope to reference-based analyses. When a reference is not available or is not a viable option due to reference-bias, error correction is a crucial step towards the reconstruction of the sequenced transcripts and downstream sequence analysis of transcripts. In this paper, we present a novel computational method to error correct ONT cDNA sequencing data, called isONcorrect. IsONcorrect is able to jointly use all isoforms from a gene during error correction, thereby allowing it to correct reads at low sequencing depths. We are able to obtain a median accuracy of 98.9‚Äì99.6%, demonstrating the feasibility of applying cost-effective cDNA full transcript length sequencing for reference-free transcriptome analysis.\nProgramming # The Little Book of Python Anti-Patterns # Do you use python for your work or research?

As a student looking at the prices, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to make my own budget one. How hard can it right? I saw some Youtube videos where people were building NAS using Raspberry Pi (RP). So I\u0026rsquo;ve started digging for some Pi machine. I ended up choosing between Banana Pi (BP) and RP 2. The advantage of BP was that it had SATA connector right on the board, which would give me better read/write throughput. Ok, let\u0026rsquo;s try it out.\nRound 1 # I found a BP Pro on site alza.cz and later on found out that it was actually a BP M1+. Never mind, the hardware configuration was the same. I\u0026rsquo;ve downloaded and installed Raspbian OS. The installation is pretty straight forward and can be found on the page or youtube. Ok, the installation was successful. Now let\u0026rsquo;s try to connect my external drive. For storage, I\u0026rsquo;ve used a 2.5\u0026quot; disk from my old notebook. Normally, if you want to connect a drive like this, you have to have an external adapter to power it up. With BP you don\u0026rsquo;t need any power adapter, the power is provided by the board when you connect the drive (Cha ching!). After connecting the disk, it\u0026rsquo;s time to mount it. Unfortunately, no new device was detected. I guess I really need an external power adapter. Tried the adapter, still nothing. Ok, now this is getting frustrating. Maybe the disk is not working properly, let\u0026rsquo;s connect it to my work station. The disk was detected immediately. I\u0026rsquo;ve spent the whole day trying to connect the drive to the BP, but with no luck. No worries, I can still buy RP 2 and try that instead. I\u0026rsquo;ve returned the BP and ordered RP 2. After one week it arrived and I could continue with my experiment.\nRound 2 # The process was the same as before. Connect all the cables to RP and install the latest Rasbian OS. However this time, there was no SATA connector. That\u0026rsquo;s why I ordered a case for 2.5\u0026quot; hard drive with USB 3.0. Yes, I know RP 2 has only USB 2.0 but I can reuse this case later in future for something else. But wait, you said that external drives have to have an external power supply. How are you going to power the drive if it\u0026rsquo;s already in a case? The cool part about RP is that you can play with the configuration. In order to connect an external drive, you have to modify config.txt file and add this line max_usb=1. With this setting, RP will use more voltage for USB, thus making it possible connecting an external drive. Ready for a test run? Yes, it worked! Mission successful! Configuration Finally, we can move on to the next step. Installing Samba for sharing and ufw for creating firewall rules. Let\u0026rsquo;s not forget to also setup SSH (I would like to disconnect the keyboard and monitor that are now connected to the RP).\n# Update your /etc/fstab to mount the drive on boot # Installation and update sudo apt-get update -y \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt-get upgrade sudo apt-get install samba ufw # Setting up Samba # Create user on raspberry: sudo useradd \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt; - shell /bin/false # Set permissions: sudo chown \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PATH_TO_DRIVE\u0026gt; # Create password for samba: sudo smbpasswd -a \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt; # Update configuration vi /etc/samba/smb.conf [SHARE] path = /mnt/share/ valid users = \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt; read only = No create mask = 0777 directory mask = 0777 # Save and exit vim (!x or !wq) # Verify the correctness of configuration testparm # Start samba sudo systemctl start samba # Check that status, you should see green Active sudo systemctl status samba # Auto start samba sudo systemctl enable samba # Setting up firewall rules # I didn\u0026#39;t have Samba listed in apps so I created my own vi /etc/ufw/applications.d/ufw-fileserver [samba] title=Samba description=Samba ports=137,138,139,445/tcp # After saving it\u0026#39;s time to setup some firewall rules # 1.

You should definitely not do this at home! I didn\u0026rsquo;t have another drive available, so I found some 4GB USB stick, which I used as my secondary drive, where I\u0026rsquo;ve backed up only the most important documents that my parents use.\n# Update /etc/fstab to mount the USB stick # Create a backup script vi ~/backup #!/bin/bash rsync -av --delete \u0026lt;DRIVE_PATH\u0026gt;/Important/ \u0026lt;BACKUP_PATH\u0026gt;/Important # Make the file executable and run it as a cron job # every day at 1.00am chmod +x backup crontab -e 0 1 * * * ~/backup I\u0026rsquo;ve setup one more backup on my desktop station. I am using Free FileSync application for backing up data. I\u0026rsquo;m using a real-time backup with mirroring option. I\u0026rsquo;ve setup one more rule to check my share folder and copy again only the most important files to the backup drive to my desktop station. This way if everything fails, I should still have some backup. How about some small scripts? I\u0026rsquo;ve played around with the first setup and created some small scripts like a welcome page, sending notifications to slack on login, etc. You can find some of them here and here.\nConclusion \u0026amp; Summary # The project started with an idea of using SATA connector for connecting the drive and sharing it locally. That quite didn\u0026rsquo;t happen, so I ended up switching to USB 2.0 on RP which has lower read/write speeds. Nevertheless, the end result was fine and the system actually worked. Now hold on a minute, why would you go through so much trouble when you could have just connected the drive to your router and share it? I could have done it right after I discovered problems with the BP. But I was curious how it would work with RP. Of course, this is not really a NAS (well sort off is), but the fun and learning outcome was worth it. To be honest, I\u0026rsquo;ve been running this setup at home for over a year without any problem what so ever. This was a very interesting project with many ups and downs. I don\u0026rsquo;t encourage you to build the same setup. I\u0026rsquo;ve just wanted to demonstrate what can be done by reusing an old hard drive and some free time.
